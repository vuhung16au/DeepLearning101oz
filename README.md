## Building the Book

The book supports both A4 and A5 paper sizes with enhanced build automation:

### Quick Build Commands

```bash
# Build A5 version (default)
make pdf

# Build A4 version
make pdf-a4

# Build A5 version (explicit)
make pdf-a5

# Build both versions
make all

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Publish PDFs to distribution folder
make publish
```

### Enhanced Build Process

The build process uses a 6-pass compilation system:
1. **Pass 1**: Initial LaTeX compilation
2. **Pass 2**: Bibliography processing (biber)
3. **Pass 3**: Glossary processing (makeglossaries)
4. **Pass 4**: Index processing (makeindex)
5. **Pass 5**: Reference resolution
6. **Pass 6**: Final compilation

### Requirements

- LaTeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or similar)
- pdflatex
- biber (for bibliography)
- makeglossaries (for glossary)
- makeindex (for index)
- Unicode and CJK support (XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX recommended)
